# hello-world

My first repository, in which I store ideas and important files.

Recently, I've been learning _Data Scientist's Toolbox_ on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), which emphasizes the importance of version control for any (future) data scientists and teaches how to use Git and GitHub in detail. And Ever since my laptop broke down and I lost all my documents (fortunately, there's nothing indispensable), I realized the importance of back-ups more and more. It seems that GitHub is not only a great place for version control, but also a free platform to keep my files updated and back-uped. So, here I am! Welcome myself to GitHub!

It's a shame that I didn't learn how to use GitHub untill the last year of my undergraduate days although I majored in data science. However, I don't want to regret this same matter till next year, I hate myself putting off everything. So let's get started!
